# My Study Diary

Welcome to my personal coding laboratory. 

This repository serves as a **Study Diary**—a raw, unfiltered collection of my learning journey across various programming languages and technologies. Here, I document exercises, lecture notes, quick experiments, and algorithmic challenges.

> **💡 Context is Key:** > This repository is a "treasure chest" of records. It prioritizes **volume of practice** over polished production code.
>
> Please note that **not all my skills are represented here**. Many technologies (like Bootstrap, advanced Git flows, and specific architectural patterns) were mastered directly within real-world projects or collaborative environments and may not have explicit entries in this diary.

## 📂 Repository Structure ( The Archives)

This vault is organized by technology stack, serving as a sandbox for experimentation:

- **[`/java/`](./java/)**: Exploring OOP, syntax, and Java ecosystem fundamentals.
- **[`/python/`](./python/)**: Scripts, automation attempts, data manipulation, and logic challenges.
- **[`/web/`](./web/)**: The playground for the web trio (HTML/CSS/JS) and component experiments.
- **[`/extras/`](./extras/)**: A mix of Shell Scripting, Docker configurations, SQL queries, and other tools.
- **[`/logs/`](./logs/)**: Markdown-based notes, cheat sheets, and thoughts on concepts learned.

## 🌿 Branching Strategy

Since this is a study repo, the flow is simplified:

- **`main`**: The consolidated library of knowledge.
- **`experiments`**: Where I break things to see how they work.
